            <p>
                I made the decision to go on a quick trip to Caza Peregrine in Antipolo, Rizal, on a sunny Saturday morning. 
                The enthusiasm of exploring a new location was evident, the sun was shining, and the air was clear. 
                I was eager to visit this little retreat, which I had heard so much about because of its calm atmosphere and stunning views.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eager to get the most out of the day, I got up early. I grabbed my camera, a water bottle, and a small backpack full of goodies after a short breakfast. 
                After consulting my maps, I made the decision to ride 
                a jeepney from my home to the busy bus station in order to find a ride to Antipolo.
